# Ping page middleware

Basic middleware for creating a ping page.  By convention this page should be served from '/ping'.

The [cf-deploy](https://github.platforms.engineering/cloud-foundry/cf-deploy) AWS deployer uses the smoke testing app to 
smoke test your temporary route in AWS CloudFoundry to enable blue/green deployments.  By convention it hits the /ping endpoint.  This applies to UIs as well as services, even though the /ping endpoint typically won't be visible externally.

Usage:

``` javascript
import ping from '@monsantoit/ping-page'
import express from 'express'
import packageJson from '../package'

const app = express.app()
const port = process.env.PORT or 3023
const anotherUrlToPing = `http://localhost:${port}/services/some-service`

app.get('/ping', ping(packageJson, [anotherUrlToPing]))
```
