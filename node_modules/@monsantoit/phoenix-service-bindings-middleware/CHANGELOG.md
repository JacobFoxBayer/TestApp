## Changelog

2.0.0 - 10/17/18 Service bindings now assigns values to window.phoenix one key at a time.

2.1.0 - Will now use name if alias does not exist for the service binding

3.0.0 - 02/13/19 The localOcelot flag is set to `true` by default when running locally - this will change the behavior of the profile client, so we're marking it as a breaking change.

3.2.0 - Fixed issue where application provided phoenix-home was not getting used for default urls & environment.  If it wasn't in VCAP_SERVICES it was falling back to defaults. 

3.3.0 - Added the ability to pull the json created in order to pull it into a file seperate from a request/response
