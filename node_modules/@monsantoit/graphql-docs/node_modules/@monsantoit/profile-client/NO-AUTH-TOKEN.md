# No Auth Token found

The service you are calling has UI security enabled, but you don't have a valid cookie for it.
Try pointing your browser to that services docs to be prompted with a PING login page.
Doing so will grant you a token and add it to your cookies for a couple hours.
You should not have this problem in non-prod or prod.
