### Troubleshooting

See below if you have never installed a package from Bayer's npm-enterprise or
run into the following error:

```bash

npm ERR! code E401
npm ERR! Unable to authenticate, your authentication token seems to be invalid.
npm ERR! To correct this please trying logging in again with:
npm ERR!     npm login

```

### Setup an access token

See the
[devtools npm-e guide](https://devtools.bayer.com/docs/development/package-management/npm/)
to learn how to create an access token if this is the first time you are using a
npm-e package at Bayer or you do not have a line that starts with the following
in your `~/.npmrc` file:

`//npm.platforms.engineering/:_authToken=`
