# InputChip

## Description

A combination of a Textfield with Chips for entering multiple small pieces of information, such as filter fields.

## See live demos on storybook

[Storybook InputChip Demos](https://element-react.bayer.com/?path=/story/components-input-chip)

## Install bundle from npm-e

```bash
npm i @element/react-components @element/themes
```

#### Optional: install the component individually

```bash
npm i @element/react-input-chip @element/themes
```

<summary>
Please Note: You will need to add @element to your .npmrc!
</summary>

Open `~/.npmrc` in an editor and add the following line to enable the `@element`
scope:

```bash

@element:registry=https://npm.platforms.engineering

```

### Troubleshooting

See below if you have never installed a package from Bayer's npm-enterprise or
run into the following error:

```bash

npm ERR! code E401
npm ERR! Unable to authenticate, your authentication token seems to be invalid.
npm ERR! To correct this please trying logging in again with:
npm ERR!     npm login

```

### Setup an access token

See the
[devtools npm-e guide](https://devtools.bayer.com/docs/development/package-management/npm/)
to learn how to create an access token if this is the first time you are using a
npm-e package at Bayer or you do not have a line that starts with the following
in your `~/.npmrc` file:

`//npm.platforms.engineering/:_authToken=`

## Notes

Chips are compact elements that allow users to enter information, select a choice, filter content, or trigger an action. **Input Chips** are used to represent small blocks of custom information that the user has entered by typing a label into a Textfield. A basic demonstration of this behavior can be found on the 'Input Custom' story, under the Chips tab, on Storybook. The Input Chip tab lists more specific details and examples.

One use of the Input Chip is setting it as **contained** or **uncontained**. Setting the input as contained shows the entered chips inside the Textfield, whereas setting the input as uncontained lists the entered chips outside of the Textfield.

Another possible variation of the Input Chip is to make it **outlined**, which puts a dark line around the Textfield where users input their custom chip labels.

Another possible variation of the Input Chip is to make the list of chips **scrollable**. This enables the user to scroll, with a mouse or trackpad, through the list of chips, if the list is longer than the alloted window.

A few notable props for Input Chip include `allowDuplicates`, which if true, allows a user to add multiple chips with the same label, `anchorInput`, which determines whether inputs show up before or after the uncontained chip list, and `resetValue`, which determines what the input value will be set to after a chip is added.

## Input Chip Breaking Changes

| Description                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| outlined (removed): Use variant in chipsProps instead.        |
| placeholder (removed): Use label in textfieldProps instead.   |
| scrollable (removed): Use scrollable in chipsProps instead.   |
| wrap (removed): No longer needed. Chips will wrap by default. |
