### Troubleshooting

See below if you have never installed a package from Bayer's npm-enterprise or
run into the following error:

```bash

npm ERR! code E401
npm ERR! Unable to authenticate, your authentication token seems to be invalid.
npm ERR! To correct this please trying logging in again with:
npm ERR!     npm login

```

### Setup an access token

See the
[devtools npm-e guide](https://devtools.bayer.com/docs/development/package-management/npm/)
to learn how to create an access token if this is the first time you are using a
npm-e package at Bayer or you do not have a line that starts with the following
in your `~/.npmrc` file:

`//npm.platforms.engineering/:_authToken=`

## Notes

There are two variants of the Circular Progress indicator, **Indeterminate** and **Determinate**. Both variants represent the progress, on a scale of 0 to 1, of the completion of a task. The same objective can be accomplished with the Linear Progress indicator, depending on which fits or looks better in certain use cases. See Storybook demos for details and examples of each.

## Usage

**Indeterminate Circular Progress** is a constantly spinning circle, as opposed to a static icon. It moves continuously, like an icon that represents something in the process of loading. Having an icon that shows active progress prevents the user from unnecessarily refreshing or navigating away from the current screen.

**Determinate Circular Progress** is a circle that increments periodically or when prompted by a user, as opposed to a circle that moves continuously. This indicator could be preferable to the Indeterminate Circular Progress indicator when it should only update with input or action from a user.
