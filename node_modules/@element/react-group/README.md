### Troubleshooting

See below if you have never installed a package from Bayer's npm-enterprise or
run into the following error:

```bash

npm ERR! code E401
npm ERR! Unable to authenticate, your authentication token seems to be invalid.
npm ERR! To correct this please trying logging in again with:
npm ERR!     npm login

```

### Setup an access token

See the
[devtools npm-e guide](https://devtools.bayer.com/docs/development/package-management/npm/)
to learn how to create an access token if this is the first time you are using a
npm-e package at Bayer or you do not have a line that starts with the following
in your `~/.npmrc` file:

`//npm.platforms.engineering/:_authToken=`

## Notes

Group allows users to organize multiple components and treat them as a single unit. Doing so ensures that the components will be arranged in a certain way, with uniform spacing between them, and be treated as a single item.

## Usage

Groups are typically used to combine smaller components. A common use case for Group is to create a Group of Textfields. An example of this could be in creating a fixed, evenly spaced form where a user is to fill in data in several inputs (ie. first name, last name, job title).
