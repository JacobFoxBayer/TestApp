# Banner

## Description

A banner displays a prominent message and related optional actions.

## See live demos on storybook

[Storybook Banner Demos](https://element-react.bayer.com/?path=/story/components-banner)

## Install bundle from npm-e

```bash
npm i @element/react-components @element/themes
```

#### Optional: install the component individually

```bash
npm i @element/react-banner @element/themes
```

<summary>
Please Note: You will need to add @element to your .npmrc!
</summary>

Open `~/.npmrc` in an editor and add the following line to enable the `@element`
scope:

```bash

@element:registry=https://npm.platforms.engineering

```

### Troubleshooting

See below if you have never installed a package from Bayer's npm-enterprise or
run into the following error:

```bash

npm ERR! code E401
npm ERR! Unable to authenticate, your authentication token seems to be invalid.
npm ERR! To correct this please trying logging in again with:
npm ERR!     npm login

```

### Setup an access token

See the
[devtools npm-e guide](https://devtools.bayer.com/docs/development/package-management/npm/)
to learn how to create an access token if this is the first time you are using a
npm-e package at Bayer or you do not have a line that starts with the following
in your `~/.npmrc` file:

`//npm.platforms.engineering/:_authToken=`

</details>

## Notes

Banners should be displayed at the top of the screen, below a top app bar.
Theyâ€™re persistent and nonmodal, allowing the user to either ignore them or
interact with them at any time. Only one banner should be shown at a time.

| Component | Priority                   | User action                                                                                               |
| --------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Snackbar  | Low priority               | Optional: Snackbars disappear automatically                                                               |
| Banner    | Prominent, medium priority | Optional: Banners remain until dismissed by the user, or if the state that caused the banner is resolved  |
| Dialog    | Highest priority           | Required: Dialogs block app usage until the user takes a dialog action or exits the dialog (if available) |

## Accessibility Considerations

The context and content surrounding banner will determine the type of ARIA and
accessibility concerns that should be maintained. In the spirit of keeping our
Banner component light, no specific accessibility concerns have been addressed
outside of semantic markup.

Each product and application will be different. To decide how best to support
users with Banner, consider some of the following questions:

-   Will Banner load into view, or will it potentially show up dynamically and
    need to be announced?
-   Will Banner be tied to another control or content piece on the page? What
    other content might Banner be labeling?
-   Will Banner's content change over time? Or will it be removed from the DOM
    each time as content changes?

In some ways, Banner _could_ act as a notification, a label, an aside,
error/form feedback, or as a live-region content announcement. In many
instances, Banner will likely be acting as a notification.
