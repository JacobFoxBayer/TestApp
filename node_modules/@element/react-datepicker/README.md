# Datepicker

## Description

Datepicker provides a way for users to select a specific date or range of dates from a dialog or dropdown.

## See live demos on storybook

[Storybook Datepicker Demos](https://element-react.bayer.com/?path=/story/components-datepicker)

## Install bundle from npm-e

```bash
npm i @element/react-components @element/themes
```

#### Optional: install the component individually

```bash
npm i @element/react-datepicker @element/themes
```

<details>

<summary>
Please Note: You will need to add @element to your .npmrc!
</summary>

Open `~/.npmrc` in an editor and add the following line to enable the `@element`
scope:

```bash

@element:registry=https://npm.platforms.engineering

```

### Troubleshooting

See below if you have never installed a package from Bayer's npm-enterprise or
run into the following error:

```bash

npm ERR! code E401
npm ERR! Unable to authenticate, your authentication token seems to be invalid.
npm ERR! To correct this please trying logging in again with:
npm ERR!     npm login

```

### Setup an access token

See the
[devtools npm-e guide](https://devtools.bayer.com/docs/development/package-management/npm/)
to learn how to create an access token if this is the first time you are using a
npm-e package at Bayer or you do not have a line that starts with the following
in your `~/.npmrc` file:

`//npm.platforms.engineering/:_authToken=`

</details>

## Keyboard Navigation

### Date Input

-   `esc` - Closes calendar
-   `ArrowDown` - Opens the calender when input is focused
-   `Enter` - If focused on the clearable icon it will clear the date picker
    value, if in the input it will submit the form.

### Calendar

-   While focused on a day arrow keys allow for navigation around the calender.
-   Enter` - Selects the focused day

## Highlighted Dates

Dates can be highlighted in a number of ways. The highlighted dates schema
includes the following fields:

| field             | description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | example(s)                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `includeDisabled` | Boolean that when set to true will highlight dates, even if they have been disabled.                                                                                                                                                                            | Enable highlighting of disabled days: <br> `{ includeDisabled: true }`                                                                                     |
| `dates`           | Array of valid date objects, most useful for scattered highlighted dates.                                                                                                                                                                                       | Highlight today and a week from today (using _date-dns add()_): <br>`{ dates: [new Date(), add(new Date(), {days: 7} ]}`.                                  |
| `days`            | Array of days of the week as integers from 0 to 6. This will highlight every day of the week specified for the visible date.                                                                                                                                    | Highlight every Wednesday: <br>`{ days: [3] }`                                                                                                             |
| `daysOfMonth`     | Array of days of the month as integers from 0 to 29-31. This will highlight every day of the month specified for the visible date.                                                                                                                              | Highlight the 1st and 15th of the month: <br>`{ daysOfMonth: [1, 15] }`                                                                                    |
| `from` and `to`   | Date objects that represent the start and end date of a range, most useful for a contiguous block of highlighted dates. If only one is supplied (either `from` or `to`) the other will be considered infinity.                                                  | Highlight every day before and including today:<br> `{to: new Date()}` <br><br> Highlight everything after (and including) today: <br>`{from: new Date()}` |
| `ranges`          | Array of objects that allows multiple `to`/`from` ranges to be specified with the same rules. This also allows a configuration where you can specify everything up to a date and also everything after a date, leaving a range of highlighted dates in between. | Only today is valid (using _date-fns add()_): <br>`{ ranges: [ {to: add(new Date(), {days: -1})}, {from: add(new Date(), {days: 1} ]}`                     |
| `customPredictor` | Custom function that will be called during evaluation.                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Highlight even days: <br>`{ customPredictor: date => date.getDate() % 2 === 0 }`                                                                           |

**Please note:** All dates are _inclusive_ and date comparisons ignore time.

## Disabled Dates

Disabled dates share a similar schema as highlighted dates. The disabled dates
schema includes the following fields:

| field             | description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | example(s)                                                                                                                                             |

| `days`            | Array of days of the week as integers from 0 to 6. This will disable every day of the week specified for the visible date.                                                                                                                                   | Disable every Wednesday: <br>`{ days: [3] }`                                                                                                           |

## Calendar

The Calendar component may now be used separately for light-weight needs. Its
features are limited and it is not intended as a full service calendar component
at this time.

## Date Formatting

Datepicker now uses `date-fns` for date formatting and supports the following
tokens.

| centuryBehavior      | string                   | 'age'           | false    | When typing a date, this will determine 2-digit year parsing behavior. A value of `forward-only` will always use current century, so `02/08/02` will parse to `02/08/2002`. A value of `age`, on the other hand is meant to assist age entry. It will use the current century until a certain point (see `centurySlidingOffset`), and then will revert to the previous century. For example `05/25/01` will parse to `05/25/2001`, while `02/08/76` will parse to `02/08/1976`.<br />Accepted Values: age, forward-only                                                                                                              |
| centurySlidingOffset | number                   | 76              | false    | Only used when `centuryBehavior` is set to `age`. This will adjust the cutoff point where 2 digit dates will revert to the previous century to aid in typed age entry. The formula for the cutoff is `last 2 digits of the result of current year minus centuryCutoffOffset`. For example, using the year 2022 and the default value of 76 we would have `lastTwoDigits(2022 - 76) = 46`. So any 2 digit year of `45` or less will become `20XX` and any 2 digit year of `46` or more will become `19XX`. A value of `0` will disable the behavior, regardless of `centuryBehavior`. In 2023, the cutoff will be `47`, and so forth. |
