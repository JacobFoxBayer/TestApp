# Snackbar

## Description

Snackbars provide brief messages about app processes at the bottom of the screen. Snackbar works differently than Modal, the user must press tab to navigate to the Snackbar to focus on it.

## Install bundle from npm-e

Please Note: You will need to add @element to your .npmrc!
</summary>

Open `~/.npmrc` in an editor and add the following line to enable the `@element`
scope:

```bash

@element:registry=https://npm.platforms.engineering

```

### Troubleshooting

See below if you have never installed a package from Bayer's npm-enterprise or
run into the following error:

```bash

npm ERR! code E401
npm ERR! Unable to authenticate, your authentication token seems to be invalid.
npm ERR! To correct this please trying logging in again with:
npm ERR!     npm login

```

### Setup an access token

See the
[devtools npm-e guide](https://devtools.bayer.com/docs/development/package-management/npm/)
to learn how to create an access token if this is the first time you are using a
npm-e package at Bayer or you do not have a line that starts with the following
in your `~/.npmrc` file:

`//npm.platforms.engineering/:_authToken=`

## Notes

## Leading

By default, Snackbars are centered horizontally within the viewport.

On larger screens, they can optionally be displayed on the leading edge of the
screen (the left side in `LTR`, or the right side in `RTL`) by setting the
`leading` prop to `true` to the root element:

## Stacked

Action buttons with long text should be positioned below the label instead of
alongside it. This can be accomplished by setting the `stacked` prop to `true`
to the root element:

## Dismiss Button

Snackbars are intended to dismiss on their own after a few seconds, but a
dedicated dismiss button may be optionally included as well for accessibility
purposes.

_NOTE_: Snackbars can disable the auto-timer dismiss in later Material versions.

## Dismiss Key

Pressing the `ESC` key while one of the Snackbar's child elements has focus
(e.g., the action button) will dismiss the Snackbar.

To disable this behavior, set `closeOnEscape` to false.
