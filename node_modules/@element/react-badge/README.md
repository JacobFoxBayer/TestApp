# Badge

## Description

Badges are colored text elements that hold small amounts of information. Badges come in two versions, Label which can be used to add context to the UI or other elements and Notification which can indicate that a certain element within the UI can be interacted with to show new or updated information.

```

### Troubleshooting

See below if you have never installed a package from Bayer's npm-enterprise or
run into the following error:

```bash

npm ERR! code E401
npm ERR! Unable to authenticate, your authentication token seems to be invalid.
npm ERR! To correct this please trying logging in again with:
npm ERR!     npm login

```

### Setup an access token

See the
[devtools npm-e guide](https://devtools.bayer.com/docs/development/package-management/npm/)
to learn how to create an access token if this is the first time you are using a
npm-e package at Bayer or you do not have a line that starts with the following
in your `~/.npmrc` file:

`//npm.platforms.engineering/:_authToken=`

## Notes

**Label Badges** are great for indicating different categories, statuses, and
products. Label Badges can include Icons, however if the Icon is a custom one,
please ensure it is AA compliant. More details on this are listed below.

**Notification Badges** are great for alerting the user of new messages, alerts,
or items that need attention. Notification Badges consist of numeric values
and/or status light badges of various colors.

## Usage

Badges are often used with other components, such as Icon and Icon Button. The
Badge on the Icon Storybook example is a custom Icon Notification Badge. The
component prevents extra small and small Icon sizes from being used as the
custom Icon.

## Accessibility Considerations

When selecting a custom Icon for a Label Badge, it is essential to ensure that
the image is AA compliant. Refer to the following link, or one of many similar
online resources, to check contrasting colors.
