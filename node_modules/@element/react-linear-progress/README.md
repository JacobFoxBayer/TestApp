Open `~/.npmrc` in an editor and add the following line to enable the `@element`
scope:

```bash

@element:registry=https://npm.platforms.engineering

```

### Troubleshooting

See below if you have never installed a package from Bayer's npm-enterprise or
run into the following error:

```bash

npm ERR! code E401
npm ERR! Unable to authenticate, your authentication token seems to be invalid.
npm ERR! To correct this please trying logging in again with:
npm ERR!     npm login

```

### Setup an access token

See the
[devtools npm-e guide](https://devtools.bayer.com/docs/development/package-management/npm/)
to learn how to create an access token if this is the first time you are using a
npm-e package at Bayer or you do not have a line that starts with the following
in your `~/.npmrc` file:

`//npm.platforms.engineering/:_authToken=`

## Notes

There are two variants of the Linear Progress indicator, **Indeterminate** and **Determinate**. Both variants represent the progress, on a scale of 0 to 1, of the completion of a task. The buffer bar is a secondary bar to indicate the amount of buffered data. The buffer bar shows the maximum width of the progress bar, which is 1 by default. Buffer is only used with the determinate Linear Progress indicator. Both the buffer bar and progress bar can be set to update from left to right or right to left with the `reversed` prop.

Progress toward a goal can also be represented with the Circular Progress indicator, depending on which fits or looks better in certain use cases. See Storybook demos for details and examples of each.

## Usage

**Indeterminate Linear Progress** is a constantly moving line segment, as opposed to a static line. Having a symbol that shows active progress prevents the user from unnecessarily refreshing or navigating away from the current screen.

**Determinate Linear Progress** is a line segment that increments periodically or when prompted by a user, as opposed to one that moves continuously. This indicator could be preferable to the Indeterminate Linear Progress indicator when it should only update with input or action from a user.
