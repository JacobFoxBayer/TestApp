# Chips

## Description

Chips are used to represent small blocks of information that the user has entered or selected. They can be one of the types Choice, Filter, or Input

## See live demos on storybook

[Storybook Chips Demos](https://element-react.bayer.com/?path=/story/components-chips)

## Install bundle from npm-e

```bash
npm i @element/react-components @element/themes
```

#### Optional: install the component individually

```bash
npm i @element/react-chips @element/themes
```

<summary>
Please Note: You will need to add @element to your .npmrc!
</summary>

Open `~/.npmrc` in an editor and add the following line to enable the `@element`
scope:

```bash

@element:registry=https://npm.platforms.engineering

```

### Troubleshooting

See below if you have never installed a package from Bayer's npm-enterprise or
run into the following error:

```bash

npm ERR! code E401
npm ERR! Unable to authenticate, your authentication token seems to be invalid.
npm ERR! To correct this please trying logging in again with:
npm ERR!     npm login

```

### Setup an access token

See the
[devtools npm-e guide](https://devtools.bayer.com/docs/development/package-management/npm/)
to learn how to create an access token if this is the first time you are using a
npm-e package at Bayer or you do not have a line that starts with the following
in your `~/.npmrc` file:

`//npm.platforms.engineering/:_authToken=`

## Notes

Notable props that are unique for each Chip include `chipIdField`, `chipKeyField`, and `chipLabelField`. Other important props include `variant`, which details whether the Chip is filled or outlined, `scrollable`, which determines whether Chips break on a newline in a list, `preventChoiceDeselection`, which prevents certain Chips from being deselected by a user, and `input`, which determines whether Chips can be dynamically added and removed.

## Usage

Chips are compact elements that allow users to enter information, select a
choice, filter content, or trigger an action. Each chip requires a unique key
which can be configured with the `chipKeyField` property. It defaults to looking
at the `id` field in each chip.

For filter and choice chips, two way data binding is accomplished via
`onUpdateSelectedChips` and `selectedChips` props. For input chips, two way data
binding is accomplished via `onUpdateChips` and `chips` props. Input chips may
be either choice or filter.

Chips can include Leading or Trailing Icons. If no Leading or Trailing Icon is set, a material icon rendering the leadingIconField, or trailingIconField, of each chip is used.
