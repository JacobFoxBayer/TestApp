# Elevation

## Description

Elevation provides a shadow and optionally padding to show the relative distance in space between two surfaces.

## See live demos on storybook

[Storybook Elevation Demos](https://element-react.bayer.com/?path=/story/components-elevation)

## Install bundle from npm-e

```bash
npm i @element/react-components @element/themes
```

#### Optional: install the component individually

```bash
npm i @element/react-elevation @element/themes
```

Please Note: You will need to add @element to your .npmrc!
</summary>

Open `~/.npmrc` in an editor and add the following line to enable the `@element`
scope:

```bash

@element:registry=https://npm.platforms.engineering

```

### Troubleshooting

See below if you have never installed a package from Bayer's npm-enterprise or
run into the following error:

```bash

npm ERR! code E401
npm ERR! Unable to authenticate, your authentication token seems to be invalid.
npm ERR! To correct this please trying logging in again with:
npm ERR!     npm login

```

### Setup an access token

See the
[devtools npm-e guide](https://devtools.bayer.com/docs/development/package-management/npm/)
to learn how to create an access token if this is the first time you are using a
npm-e package at Bayer or you do not have a line that starts with the following
in your `~/.npmrc` file:

`//npm.platforms.engineering/:_authToken=`

## Notes

Some important props for Elevation include `outlined`, which determines whether or not the elevated object has a border around or just a shadow beneath it, `rounded`, which gives the elevated object a border radius of 8px, `transition`, which shows an animation when the object's elevation is changed, and finally `padding`, which adds padding around the child content and accepts `standard`, `dense`, `airy`, or custom values.

The `customPadding` prop for Elevation can be set to any user determined value, but must be passed in as a valid CSS padding declaration. i.e. 38px. This value will overwrite one of the preset `padding` values, if both are set.

The `elevation` prop can be set to a value ranging from 0, which shows no visible difference between surfaces, to 24, which creates the darkest shadow between the chosen object and the background surface.

## Usage

The Elevation component is used as a container around content or other controls. The elevation applied to other components, like Button and Card, is implemented separately, as shown in Storybook demos and code snippets.
