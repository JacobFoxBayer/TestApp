# Radio

## Description

Radio Buttons are selection controls that enable users to choose a single option from among multiple onscreen options. Selection controls are found where users are asked to make decisions or declare preferences.

## Install bundle from npm-e

### Troubleshooting

See below if you have never installed a package from Bayer's npm-enterprise or
run into the following error:

```bash

npm ERR! code E401
npm ERR! Unable to authenticate, your authentication token seems to be invalid.
npm ERR! To correct this please trying logging in again with:
npm ERR!     npm login

```

### Setup an access token

See the
[devtools npm-e guide](https://devtools.bayer.com/docs/development/package-management/npm/)
to learn how to create an access token if this is the first time you are using a
npm-e package at Bayer or you do not have a line that starts with the following
in your `~/.npmrc` file:

`//npm.platforms.engineering/:_authToken=`

## Notes

Radios are one of several selection controls. A Radio gives the user two, or usually more, options when taking input. A few notable props for Radio include `alignEnd`, which changes the alignment of the label and the Radio, `checked`, which shows the Radio as selected due to either user input or being programmatically set, and `hideLabel`, which causes the label not be displayed, although it will still be available to screen readers.

## Usage

Since many selection inputs exist, Radio is a good choice for scenarios when a few options are presented to a user. When many options exist, Select may be a better option. Checkbox and Switch offer other alternatives for taking user input when only two options are available. Examples and demos of this functionality is included under the corresponding Storybook tabs.
