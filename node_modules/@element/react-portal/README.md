## Description

Portal provides an easy way to render a child component outside of its parent component.

## See live demos on storybook

[Storybook Portal Demos](https://element-react.bayer.com/?path=/story/components-portal)

## Install bundle from npm-e

npm i @element/react-components @element/themes
```

#### Optional: install the component individually

```bash
npm i @element/react-portal @element/themes
```

Please Note: You will need to add @element to your .npmrc!
</summary>

Open `~/.npmrc` in an editor and add the following line to enable the `@element`
scope:

```bash

@element:registry=https://npm.platforms.engineering

```

### Troubleshooting

See below if you have never installed a package from Bayer's npm-enterprise or
run into the following error:

```bash

npm ERR! code E401
npm ERR! Unable to authenticate, your authentication token seems to be invalid.
npm ERR! To correct this please trying logging in again with:
npm ERR!     npm login

```

### Setup an access token

See the
[devtools npm-e guide](https://devtools.bayer.com/docs/development/package-management/npm/)
to learn how to create an access token if this is the first time you are using a
npm-e package at Bayer or you do not have a line that starts with the following
in your `~/.npmrc` file:

`//npm.platforms.engineering/:_authToken=`

## Notes

Portal is used for rendering content outside of its parent component, to improve readability and allow for smoother navigation.

Some important props for Portal include `portalContainer`, which is a DOM element for children to render in, and `children`, which represents the content to be rendered. If hoisted is true and `portalContainer` is undefined, it defaults to render in `document.body`, but only for React. In Vue, it will never render to `document.body`, you have to add the Portal Target component to where you want it to render to.

## Usage

Portal is commonly used with hoisted components, like Tooltip, for example.
