# Switch

## Description

The Switch is a simple selection control that can have an on and off state. Selection controls are found where users are asked to make decisions or declare preferences.

Open `~/.npmrc` in an editor and add the following line to enable the `@element`
scope:

```bash

@element:registry=https://npm.platforms.engineering

```

### Troubleshooting

See below if you have never installed a package from Bayer's npm-enterprise or
run into the following error:

```bash

npm ERR! code E401
npm ERR! Unable to authenticate, your authentication token seems to be invalid.
npm ERR! To correct this please trying logging in again with:
npm ERR!     npm login

```

### Setup an access token

See the
[devtools npm-e guide](https://devtools.bayer.com/docs/development/package-management/npm/)
to learn how to create an access token if this is the first time you are using a
npm-e package at Bayer or you do not have a line that starts with the following
in your `~/.npmrc` file:

`//npm.platforms.engineering/:_authToken=`

## Notes

Switches are one of several selection controls. A common use of switches would be the 'on/off' function. Clicking on the switch will toggle the checked attribute.

## Usage

Since many selection inputs exist, Switch should be used only when there are two options. For example, if on/off is requested of a user. Radio and Checkbox offer other alternatives for taking user input when more options are available. Examples and demos of this functionality are included under the corresponding Storybook tabs.
